# Vantage

Design files and firmware of the **Vantage** IoT sensor node, by Team sevenUP. The node is the field unit of a
flood-monitoring system. This repository holds the hardware (schematics, PCB layout, libraries, drawings and the
instruction documents) and the node firmware.

**Current revision: Rev A** (2026-10-25), tag `rev-A`.

| Board | Status |
|---|---|
| Sensor board | Schematic and PCB complete. Single-sided, made at home by toner transfer. |
| Power board | Schematic complete. PCB layout not started yet. |

The node is two boards joined by one 6-way JST XH cable (J1 to J1):

- **Sensor board**: carries the ESP32-S3 dev board (YD-ESP32-S3, header rows 25.4 mm apart) and the sensor
  interfaces: AJ-SR04M ultrasonic, BME280, rain gauge, TF-Luna (optional).
- **Power board**: 18650 cell with protection, solar MPPT charger, 3.3 V buck-boost with ideal diode, switched
  5 V for the sensors (SENS_EN) and two INA226 current monitors.

## Opening the design

The KiCad files are in the KiCad 7 format; KiCad 8, 9 and 10 open them. The first save in KiCad 10 upgrades the
file format; commit that upgrade on its own, without other changes, so later diffs stay readable.

Both projects use the shared library in `lib/` through their own library tables, so no global library setup is
needed.

## Title blocks

Every file carries the same title block content: **Team sevenUP**, title **Vantage — Sensor board** or
**Vantage — Power board**, date and revision. No comment lines. The documents carry the same fields in the title
block on their cover.

## Revisions

All files of a release share one revision letter, shown in every title block and on the document covers. Each
release is tagged `rev-<letter>` and listed in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Things that need to change are
tracked as GitHub issues.

To make a new revision:

1. Change the design in KiCad.
2. Set the new revision letter and date in the title block of every changed file (Page Settings in KiCad).
3. Regenerate the drawings: `python3 tools/make_outputs.py`, or plot them from KiCad.
4. Update the BOM and drill CSV files if parts or holes changed.
5. Update the document sources (`edition`, `date`, `rev` and the content) and rebuild: `python3 docs/src/build.py`.
6. Add the revision to `CHANGELOG.md`, commit, and tag it `rev-<letter>`.

## Rebuilding the outputs

Drawings (needs KiCad's `kicad-cli` on the PATH, or its path in `KICAD_CLI`):

```
pip install pypdf reportlab
python3 tools/make_outputs.py
```

Documents:

```
pip install markdown beautifulsoup4 weasyprint
python3 docs/src/build.py
